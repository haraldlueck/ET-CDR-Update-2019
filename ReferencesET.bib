	development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now
	operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational
	wave strains smaller than one part in 10 21 . With this unprecedented
	sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits

  abstract = {Virgo is a power recycled Michelson interferometer, with 3 km long
	Fabry--Perot cavities in the arms. The locking of the interferometer
	has been obtained with an original lock acquisition technique. The
	main idea is to lock the instrument away from its working point.
	Lock is obtained by misaligning the power recycling mirror and detuning
	the Michelson from the dark fringe. In this way, a good fraction
	of light escapes through the antisymmetric port and the power build-up
	inside the recycling cavity is extremely low. The benefit is that
	all the degrees of freedom are controlled when they are almost decoupled,
	and the linewidth of the recycling cavity is large. The interferometer
	is then adiabatically brought on to the dark fringe. This technique
	is referred to as variable finesse, since the recycling cavity is
	considered as a variable finesse Fabry--Perot. This technique has
	been widely tested and allows us to reach the dark fringe in few
	minutes, in an essentially deterministic way.},

  abstract = {Detecting gravitational wave bursts (characterized by short durations
	and poorly modeled waveforms) requires coincidences between several
	interferometric detectors in order to reject nonstationary noise
	events. As the wave amplitude seen in a detector depends on its location
	with respect to the source direction and as the signal to noise ratio
	of these bursts is expected to be low, coincidences between antennas
	may not be very likely. This paper investigates this question from
	a statistical point of view by using a simple model of a network
	of detectors; it also estimates the timing precision of a detection
	in an interferometer, which is an important issue for the reconstruction
	of the source location based on time delays.},

  abstract = {Current expectations on the signal-to-noise ratios and masses of supermassive
	black holes which the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can
	observe are based on using in matched filtering only the dominant
	harmonic of the inspiral waveform at twice the orbital frequency.
	Other harmonics will affect the signal-to-noise ratio of systems
	currently believed to be observable by LISA. More significantly,
	inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would mean that
	more massive systems that were previously thought to be not visible
	in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates
	show that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach
	of LISA and observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black
	holes of masses ?108M?. More specifically, with the inclusion of
	all known harmonics LISA will be able to observe even supermassive
	black hole coalescences with total mass ?108M?(109M?) (and mass ratio
	0.1) for a low frequency cutoff of 10-4??Hz (10-5??Hz) with an SNR
	up to ?60 (?30) at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the
	astrophysical viewpoint since observational evidence for the existence
	of black holes in this mass range is quite strong and binaries containing
	such supermassive black holes will be inaccessible to LISA if one
	uses as detection templates only the dominant harmonic},

	several microns per day due to a series of microscopic yielding events
	(micro-creep). This process induces a mechanical displacement shot-noise
	on the optical component which can dominate the small displacements
	produced by gravitational waves. The use of a special precipitation

	black holes (BHs) that originate from single stars in different environments.
	In particular, we calculate the dependence of maximum BH mass on
	metallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates (e.g., Hurley
	et al. and Vink et al.). Our calculations show that the highest mass
	BHs observed in the Galaxy M bh ~ 15 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]
	{sun} in the high metallicity environment ( Z = Z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]
	{sun} = 0.02) can be explained with stellar models and the wind mass
	loss rates adopted here. To reach this result we had to set luminous
	blue variable mass loss rates at the level of ~10 ?4 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]
	{sun} yr ?1 and to employ metallicity-dependent Wolf-Rayet winds.
	With such winds, calibrated on Galactic BH mass measurements, the
	maximum BH mass obtained for moderate metallicity ( Z = 0.3 Z ##IMG##
	[http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} = 0.006) is M bh,max
	= 30 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} .
	This is a rather striking finding as the mass of the most massive
	known stellar BH is M bh = 23-34 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]
	{sun} and, in fact, it is located in a small star-forming galaxy
	with moderate metallicity. We find that in the very low (globular
	cluster-like) metallicity environment the maximum BH mass can be
	as high as M bh,max = 80 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]
	{sun} ( Z = 0.01 Z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]
	{sun} = 0.0002). It is interesting to note that X-ray luminosity
	from Eddington-limited accretion onto an 80 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif]
	{sun} BH is of the order of ~10 40 erg s ?1 and is comparable to
	luminosities of some known ultra-luminous X-ray sources. We emphasize
	that our results were obtained for single stars only and that binary
	interactions may alter these maximum BH masses (e.g., accretion from
	a close companion). This is strictly a proof-of-principle study which
	demonstrates that stellar models can naturally explain even the most
	massive known stellar BHs.},

  abstract = {GRB 080913 and GRB 090423 are the most distant gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
	known to date, with spectroscopically determined redshifts of z =
	6.7 and z = 8.1, respectively. The detection of bursts at this early
	epoch of the universe significantly constrains the nature of GRBs
	and their progenitors. We perform population synthesis studies of
	the formation and evolution of early stars, and calculate the resulting
	formation rates of short- and long-duration GRBs at high redshift.
	The peak of the GRB rate from Population II stars occurs at z ~ 7
	for a model with efficient/fast mixing of metals, while it is found
	at z ~ 3 for an inefficient/slow metallicity evolution model. We
	show that in the redshift range 6 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif]
	{lsim} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim}
	10, essentially all GRBs originate from Population II stars, regardless
	of the metallicity evolution model. These stars (having small, but
	non-zero metallicity) are the most likely progenitors for both long
	GRBs (collapsars) and short GRBs (neutron star-neutron star or blackhole-neutron
	star mergers) at this epoch. Although the predicted intrinsic rates
	of long and short GRBs are similar at these high redshifts, observational
	selection effects lead to higher (a factor of ~10) observed rates
	for long GRBs. We conclude that the two recently observed high- z
	GRB events are most likely long GRBs originating from Population
	II collapsars.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of 15 orbits of an equal-mass binary black-hole
	system are presented. Gravitational waveforms from these simulations,
	covering more than 30 cycles and ending about 1.5 cycles before merger,
	are compared with those from quasicircular zero-spin post-Newtonian
	(PN) formulae. The cumulative phase uncertainty of these comparisons
	is about 0.05 radians, dominated by effects arising from the small
	residual spins of the black holes and the small residual orbital
	eccentricity in the simulations. Matching numerical results to PN
	waveforms early in the run yields excellent agreement (within 0.05
	radians) over the first ?15 cycles, thus validating the numerical
	simulation and establishing a regime where PN theory is accurate.
	In the last 15 cycles to merger, however, generic time-domain Taylor
	approximants build up phase differences of several radians. But,
	apparently by coincidence, one specific post-Newtonian approximant,
	TaylorT4 at 3.5PN order, agrees much better with the numerical simulations,
	with accumulated phase differences of less than 0.05 radians over
	the 30-cycle waveform. Gravitational-wave amplitude comparisons are
	also done between numerical simulations and post-Newtonian, and the
	agreement depends on the post-Newtonian order of the amplitude expansion:
	the amplitude difference is about 6{\%}?7{\%} for zeroth order and
	becomes smaller for increasing order. A newly derived 3.0PN amplitude
	correction improves agreement significantly (<1{\%} amplitude difference
	throughout most of the run, increasing to 4{\%} near merger) over
	the previously known 2.5PN amplitude terms},

	The material used for their construction is maraging steel, a low-carbon-content

	Young's modulus, the shear modulus, the Poisson ratio and the corresponding
	elastic energy-loss coefficients have been measured. The measurements
	have been performed on specimens subjected to the same thermal treatments
	as those of elements for the Virgo interferometer realized with maraging
	steel. In addition, anelastic properties of the material subjected

	that, for a maraging-steel structure (one free of plastic deformation),
	which undergoes an excitation with flexural vibrations, the elastic
	energy-loss coefficient can vary over a wide range as a function
	of the thermal treatment of the material and it is dominated by the
	thermo-elastic effect. The main reason for such a great alteration
	is supposed to be the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the
	average sizes of the precipitate particles and their relative separations.},

  abstract = {We study the phenomenological consequences of amplitude-corrected
	post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational waveforms, as opposed to the more
	commonly used restricted PN waveforms, for the quasi-circular, adiabatic
	inspiral of compact binary objects. In the case of initial detectors
	it has been shown that the use of amplitude-corrected waveforms for
	detection templates would lead to significantly lower signal-to-noise
	ratios (SNRs) than those suggested by simulations based exclusively
	on restricted waveforms. We further elucidate the origin of the effect
	by an in-depth analytic treatment. The discussion is extended to
	advanced detectors, where new features emerge. Non-restricted waveforms
	are linear combinations of harmonics in the orbital phase, and in
	the frequency domain the kth harmonic is cut off at kfLSO, with fLSO
	the orbital frequency at the last stable orbit. As a result, with
	non-restricted templates it is possible to achieve sizeable signal-to-noise
	ratios in cases where the dominant harmonic (which is the one at
	twice the orbital phase) does not enter the detector's bandwidth.
	This will have important repercussions on the detection of binary
	inspirals involving intermediate-mass black holes. For sources at
	a distance of 100 Mpc, taking into account the higher harmonics will
	double the mass reach of Advanced LIGO, and that of EGO gets tripled.
	Conservative estimates indicate that the restricted waveforms underestimate
	detection rates for intermediate mass binary inspirals by at least
	a factor of 20.},

	been thought that beating this SQL would require a radical redesign

	currently planned for 2006, can beat the SQL by as much as a factor
	two over a bandwidth ? f ~ f , if their thermal noise can be pushed
	low enough. This is due to dynamical correlations between photon
	shot noise and radiation-pressure noise, produced by the LIGO-II

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {We calibrate the effective-one-body (EOB) model to an accurate numerical
	simulation of an equal-mass, non-spinning binary black-hole coalescence
	produced by the Caltech-Cornell collaboration. Aligning the EOB and
	numerical waveforms at low frequency over a time interval of ~1000M,
	and taking into account the uncertainties in the numerical simulation,
	we investigate the significance and degeneracy of the EOB adjustable
	parameters during inspiral, plunge and merger, and determine the
	minimum number of EOB adjustable parameters that achieves phase and
	amplitude agreements on the order of the numerical error. We find
	that phase and fractional amplitude differences between the numerical
	and EOB values of the dominant gravitational wave mode h22 can be
	reduced to 0.02 radians and 2%, respectively, until a time 26 M before
	merger, and to 0.1 radians and 10%, at a time 16M after merger (during
	ringdown), respectively. Using LIGO, Enhanced LIGO and Advanced LIGO
	noise curves, we find that the overlap between the EOB and the numerical
	h22, maximized only over the initial phase and time of arrival, is
	larger than 0.999 for equal-mass binary black holes with total mass
	30-150 Msun. In addition to the leading gravitational mode (2,2),
	we compare the dominant subleading modes (4,4) and (3,2) and find
	phase and amplitude differences on the order of the numerical error.
	We also determine the mass-ratio dependence of one of the EOB adjustable
	parameters by fitting to numerical it inspiral waveforms for black-hole
	binaries with mass ratios 2:1 and 3:1. These results improve and
	extend recent successful attempts aimed at providing gravitational-wave
	data analysts the best analytical EOB model capable of interpolating
	accurate numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {We present an accurate approximation of the full gravitational radiation
	waveforms generated in the merger of non-eccentric systems of two
	non-spinning black holes. Utilizing information from recent numerical
	relativity simulations and the natural flexibility of the effective-one-body
	(EOB) model, we extend the latter so that it can successfully match
	the numerical relativity waveforms during the last stages of inspiral,
	merger and ringdown. By ``successfully'' here, we mean with phase
	differences < 8{\%} of a gravitational-wave cycle accumulated by
	the end of the ringdown phase, maximizing only over time of arrival
	and initial phase. We obtain this result by simply adding a 4-post-Newtonian
	order correction in the EOB radial potential and determining the
	(constant) coefficient by imposing high-matching performances with
	numerical waveforms of mass ratios m1/m2 = 1, 3/2, 2 and 4, m1 and
	m2 being the individual black-hole masses. The final black-hole mass
	and spin predicted by the numerical simulations are used to determine
	the ringdown frequency and decay time of three quasi-normal-mode
	damped sinusoids that are attached to the EOB inspiral-(plunge) waveform
	at the EOB light-ring. The EOB waveforms might be tested and further
	improved in the future by comparison with extremely long and accurate
	inspiral numerical-relativity waveforms. They may already be employed
	for coherent searches and parameter estimation of gravitational waves
	emitted by non-spinning coalescing binary black holes with ground-based
	laser-interferometer detectors.},

	with the main goal to significantly improve the sensitivity of the

	limit the present sensitivity of the interferometers are the thermal
	noise of the suspended optics and the thermal lensing process. At
	low temperature it is possible to reduce both these effects. Pulse
	tube cryocooler technology is a quite promising in this field, but
	it vibrates and it implies a mechanical link between the cooling
	element (cold finger) and the thermal load. We developed a vibration-free
	cryostat equipped with soft mechanical links to attenuate the transmission
	of cold finger vibration whose amplitude is attenuated by more than
	two orders of magnitude by means of an active system. (c) 2006 American

  abstract = {Recent X-ray observations of many galaxies, combined with optical
	observations of Galactic globular clusters, provide evidence for
	a population of Black Holes (BH) with masses of hundreds to thousands
	of solar masses. These candidate intermediate-mass BHs are often
	found in high density stellar clusters, where dynamical braking is
	rapid and hence massive stars are expected to sink to the center
	of the clusters within a few million years. In this same timescale,
	heavy star binary systems are expected to undergo numerous three-body
	interactions, tightening them and causing massive BHs to undergo
	multiple coalescences. At the BH masses implied by observations,
	these coalescences will take place below 100?Hz. There are advances
	in technology that make instruments to observe these events feasible.
	For example, new measurements of fused silica quality factors, as
	well as new wide beam technologies, can drive the thermal noise of
	large mirrors sufficiently low to allow monitoring of these low frequency
	BH-BH inspirals. It is possible to suspend an additional LF interferometer
	in the advanced LIGO beam pipes and within the existing LIGO facilities.
	This additional interferometer could be operated simultaneously with
	the advanced LIGO ones, thus providing both matching companions for
	the LF Virgo GW interferometer, and suitable triggers for higher
	frequency merging and ring-down signals to be measured in advanced
	LIGO.},

	problems faced by experimental physicists. One of the most significant
	limits to the sensitivity of current, and future, long-baseline interferometric
	gravitational wave detectors is thermal displacement noise of the
	test masses and their suspensions. Detector suspension thermal noise
	will be an important noise source at operating frequencies between
	approximately 10 and 30 Hz, and results from a combination of thermoelastic
	damping, surface and bulk losses associated with the suspension fibres.
	However its effects can be reduced by minimizing the thermoelastic
	loss and optimization of pendulum dilution factor via appropriate
	choice of suspension fibre and attachment geometry. This paper will
	discuss finite element modelling and associated analysis of the loss
	in quasi-monolithic silica fibre suspensions for future advanced

	black holes during the final stages of inspiral and merger by introducing
	in the third post-Newtonian (3PN) effective-one-body (EOB) templates
	seven new ``flexibility'' parameters that affect the two-body dynamics
	and gravitational radiation emission. The plausible ranges of these
	flexibility parameters, notably the parameter characterising the
	fourth post-Newtonian effects in the dynamics, are estimated. Using
	these estimates, we show that the currently available standard 3PN
	bank of EOB templates does ``span'' the space of signals opened up
	by all the flexibility parameters, in that their maximized mutual
	overlaps are larger than 96.5{\%}. This confirms the effectualness
	of 3PN EOB templates for the detection of binary black holes in gravitational-wave
	data from interferometric detectors. The possibility to drastically
	reduce the number of EOB templates using a few ``universal'' phasing
	functions is suggested.},

  abstract = {We continue the program of constructing, within the Effective-One-Body
	(EOB) approach, high accuracy, faithful analytic waveforms describing
	the gravitational wave signal emitted by inspiralling and coalescing
	binary black holes (BHs). We present the comparable-mass version
	of a new, resummed 3PN-accurate EOB quadrupolar waveform recently
	introduced in the small-mass-ratio limit. We compare the phase and
	the amplitude of this waveform to the recently published results
	of a high-accuracy numerical relativity (NR) simulation of 15 orbits
	of an inspiralling equal-mass binary BHs system performed by the
	Caltech-Cornell group. We find a remarkable agreement, both in phase
	and in amplitude, between the new EOB waveform and the published
	numerical data. More precisely: (i) in the gravitational wave (GW)
	frequency domain $M\omega <0.08$ where the phase of one of the non-resummed
	``Taylor approximant'' (T4) waveform matches well with the numerical
	relativity one, we find that the EOB phase fares as well, while (ii)
	for higher GW frequencies, $0.08<M\omega\lesssim 0.14$, where the
	TaylorT4 approximant starts to significantly diverge from the NR
	phase, we show that the EOB phase continues to match well the NR
	one. We further propose various methods of tuning the two inspiral
	flexibility parameters, $a_5$ and $v_{\rm pole}$, of the EOB waveform
	so as to ``best fit'' EOB predictions to numerical data. We find
	that the maximal dephasing between EOB and NR can then be reduced
	below $10^{-3}$ GW cycles over the entire span (30 GW cycles) of
	the simulation. Our resummed EOB amplitude agrees much better with
	the NR one than any of the previously considered non-resummed, post-Newtonian
	one.},

  abstract={We suggest that the collapsing core of a massive rotating star may fragment to produce two or more compact objects. Their coalescence under gravitational radiation gives the resulting black hole or neutron star a significant kick velocity, which may explain those observed in pulsars. A gamma-ray burst can result only when this kick is small. Thus, only a small fraction of core-collapse supernovae produce gamma-ray bursts. The burst may be delayed significantly (hours to days) after the supernova, as suggested by recent observations. If our picture is correct, core-collapse supernovae should be significant sources of gravitational radiation with a chirp signal similar to a coalescing neutron star binary.}

  abstract = {Thermal noise is a limiting factor of interferometric Gravitational
	Wave detectors sensitivity in the low and intermediate frequency
	range. A concrete possibility for beating this limit, is represented
	by the development of a cryogenic last stage suspension to be integrated
	within a complex seismic isolation system. To this purpose a last
	stage payload prototype has been designed and built. It has been
	suspended within a dedicated cryostat with the same technique adopted
	for the VIRGO payload and making use of two thin wires in a cradle
	configuration to support a mirror made of silicon. The cooling strategy,
	the thermal behaviour and the system mechanical response have been
	deeply studied while a measurement characterization campaign has
	been performed both at room temperature and at cryogenic temperature.
	In this paper, the preliminary results obtained together with the
	first cooling down of the 300 kg overal mass payload at about 25
	K, are reported. This study will play a driving role in the design
	of the third generation Gravitational Wave detector. },

  abstract = {The upcoming European design study 'Einstein gravitational-wave Telescope'
	represents the first step towards a substantial, international effort
	for the design of a third-generation interferometric gravitational

	might not be installed into existing infrastructures but will provoke
	a new search for optimal detector sites. Consequently, the detector
	design could be subject to fewer constraints than the on-going design
	of the second-generation instruments. In particular, it will be prudent
	to investigate alternatives to the traditional L-shaped Michelson
	interferometer. In this paper, we review an old proposal to use three
	Michelson interferometers in a triangular configuration. We use this
	example of a triple Michelson interferometer to clarify the terminology
	and will put this idea into the context of more recent research on
	interferometer technologies. Furthermore, the benefits of a triangular
	detector will be used to motivate this design as a good starting
	point for a more detailed research effort towards a third-generation

  journal = {arXiv:0907.5450},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {We discuss the capability of a third-generation ground-based detector
	such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) to enhance our astrophysical
	knowledge through detections of gravitational waves emitted by binaries
	including intermediate-mass and massive black holes. The design target
	for such instruments calls for improved sensitivity at low frequencies,
	specifically in the ~ 1-10 Hz range. This will allow the detection
	of gravitational waves generated in binary systems containing black
	holes of intermediate mass, ~ 100-1000 solar masses. We primarily
	discuss two different source types -- mergers between two intermediate
	mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass, and intermediate-mass-ratio
	inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with mass ~ 1-10 solar
	masses into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in dark matter
	halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of
	very massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway
	stellar collisions in globular clusters. In this paper, we discuss
	both formation channels, and both classes of merger in each case.
	We review existing rate estimates where these exist in the literature,
	and provide some new calculations for the approximate numbers of
	events that will be seen by a detector like the ET. These results
	indicate that the ET may see a few to a few thousand comparable-mass
	IMBH mergers and as many as several hundred IMRI events per year.
	These observations will significantly enhance our understanding of
	galactic black-hole growth, of the existence and properties of IMBHs
	and of the astrophysics of globular clusters. We finish our review
	with a discussion of some more speculative sources of gravitational
	waves for the ET, including hypermassive white dwarfs and eccentric
	compact-object binaries.},

  title = {Probing seed black holes using future gravitational-wave detectors},
  journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {26},
  pages = {204009},
  abstract = {Identifying the properties of the first generation of seeds of massive
	black holes is key to understanding the merger history and growth
	of galaxies. Mergers between ~100 solar mass seed black holes generate
	gravitational waves in the 0.1-10Hz band that lies between the sensitivity
	bands of existing ground-based detectors and the planned space-based
	gravitational wave detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
	(LISA). However, there are proposals for more advanced detectors
	that will bridge this gap, including the third generation ground-based
	Einstein Telescope and the space-based detector DECIGO. In this paper
	we demonstrate that such future detectors should be able to detect
	gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of the first generation
	of light seed black-hole binaries and provide information on the
	evolution of structure in that era. These observations will be complementary
	to those that LISA will make of subsequent mergers between more massive
	black holes. We compute the sensitivity of various future detectors
	to seed black-hole mergers, and use this to explore the number and
	properties of the events that each detector might see in three years
	of observation. For this calculation, we make use of galaxy merger
	trees and two different seed black hole mass distributions in order
	to construct the astrophysical population of events. We also consider
	the accuracy with which networks of future ground-based detectors
	will be able to measure the parameters of seed black hole mergers,
	in particular the luminosity distance to the source. We show that
	distance precisions of ~30{\%} are achievable, which should be sufficient
	for us to say with confidence that the sources are at high redshift.},

	(picosecond, femtosecond) pulses demonstrate the potential of the
	thin-disk laser design. The scaling laws for this laser design show
	that the power limit for CW operation is far beyond 40 kW for one
	single disk and the energy limit is higher than 3 J from one disk
	in pulsed operation. Also, the applicability of the thin-disk laser
	concept to optically pumped semiconductor structures will be discussed.
	When pumping directly into the quantum wells, the energy defect between
	the pump photon and the laser photon can be smaller than 5\{\%},
	thus reducing the waste heat generated inside the semiconductor structure.
	First results demonstrate the potential of this new concept. Finally,
	a short overview of the industrial realization of the thin-disk laser

  abstract = {The British�German gravitational wave detector GEO 600 has concluded
	a long observational period called Astrowatch , which lasted from
	November 2007 to July 2009. Together with the LIGO-H2 detector, GEO
	600 was kept observing, while other detectors of the world-wide network
	of laser-interferometers like LIGO(L1 and H1) and Virgo were upgraded.
	A fraction of the time during the astrowatch period was set apart
	for noise investigations and experiments preparing future upgrades.
	Even with these investigations GEO 600 reached an observation time
	of 86.0% of the overall time, such that a total of 522 days worth
	of data were collected. The average sensitivity was roughly a factor
	of 2 lower than that of the LIGO-H2 detector for frequencies above
	500 Hz. In July 2009 GEO 600 has started an upgrade program called
	GEO-HF . Within this program we aim at improving the sensitivity
	by a number of sequential upgrades, like tuned signal recycling,
	DC readout, output mode-cleaning, injection of squeezed vacuum states
	and the increase of circulating light power. Tuned signal recycling
	and DC readout have already been implemented and can be operated
	robustly, due to a new technique associated with the automatic alignment
	system.},

	interferometric gravitational-wave detectors with additional input

	detection. We combine the work of Buonanno and Chen on the quantum
	noise of signal-recycled interferometers with ordinary input and
	output optics, and the work of Kimble et al. on frequency-dependent
	input and output optics with conventional interferometers. Analytical
	formulas for the optimal input and output frequency dependencies
	are obtained. It is shown that injecting squeezed light with the
	optimal frequency-dependent squeezing angle into the dark port yields
	an improvement in the noise spectral density by a factor of e-2r
	(in power) over the entire squeezing bandwidth, where r is the squeezing
	parameter. It is further shown that a frequency-dependent (variational)
	homodyne readout leads to an additional increase in sensitivity which
	is significant in the wings of the doubly resonant structure. The
	optimal variational input squeezing in the case of an ordinary output
	homodyne detection is shown to be realizable by applying two optical
	filters on a frequency-independent squeezed vacuum. Throughout this
	paper, we take as an example the signal-recycled topology currently
	being completed at the GEO 600 site. However, theoretical results
	obtained here are also applicable to the proposed topology of the

	is a well-known problem. Typically, concern arises due to the possibility
	of increased thermal noise due to a lowering of the quality factor

	increased displacement noise arising from charge migration on the
	surface of the test masses. Recent experience gained at the GEO 600
	gravitational wave detector has highlighted an additional problem.
	GEO 600 uses electrostatic actuators to control the longitudinal
	position of the main test masses. The presence of charge on the test
	masses is shown to strongly affect the performance of the electrostatic
	actuators. This paper reports on a measurement scheme whereby the
	charge state of the GEO 600 test masses can be measured using the
	electrostatic actuators. The resulting measurements are expressed
	in terms of an effective bias voltage on the electrostatic actuators.
	We also describe attempts to remove the charge from the test masses
	and we show that the use of UV illumination was the most successful.
	Using UV illumination we were able to discharge and re-charge the

  abstract = {The British/German gravitational wave detector GEO 600 located near
	Hannover in Germany is the first large-scale gravitational-wave detector
	using the advanced technique of signal recycling. Currently the instrument
	operates in detuned signal recycling mode. Several problems arise
	due to the fact that the signal recycling cavity changes amplitude
	and phase of all light fields (carrier and sidebands) present at
	the dark-port. In addition,in the case of detuned signal recycling
	this leads to unbalanced sideband fields at the detector output.
	The large amplitude modulation caused by this asymmetry does not
	carry any gravitational wave information,but might be the cause of
	saturation and nonlinearities on the main photodiode. We developed
	and demonstrated a new control method to realize tuned signal recycling
	operation in a large-scale gravitational wave detector. A detailed
	comparison of tuned and detuned signal recycling operation is given.
	The response function of the system (optical gain) was measured and
	compared,as was the size of amplitude modulation on the main photodiode.
	Some important noise couplings were measured and partly found to
	be strongly reduced in the case of tuned signal recycling operation.},

  abstract = {When ambient seismic waves pass near and under an interferometric
	gravitational-wave detector, they induce density perturbations in
	the Earth, which in turn produce fluctuating gravitational forces
	on the interferometer?s test masses. These forces mimic a stochastic
	background of gravitational waves and thus constitute a noise source.
	This seismic gravity-gradient noise has been estimated and discussed
	previously by Saulson using a simple model of the Earth?s ambient
	seismic motions. In this paper, we develop a more sophisticated model
	of these motions, based on the theory of multimode Rayleigh and Love
	waves propagating in a multilayer medium that approximates the geological
	strata at the LIGO sites, and we use this model to reexamine seismic
	gravity gradients. We characterize the seismic gravity-gradient noise
	by a transfer function, T(f)?x?(f)/W?(f), from the spectrum of rms
	seismic displacements averaged over vertical and horizontal directions,
	W?(f), to the spectrum of interferometric test-mass motions, x?(f)?Lh?(f);
	here L is the interferometer arm length, h?(f) is the gravitational-wave
	noise spectrum, and f is frequency. Our model predicts a transfer
	function with essentially the same functional form as that derived
	by Saulson, T?4?G?(2?f)-2?(f), where ? is the density of Earth near
	the test masses, G is Newton?s constant, and ?(f)??(f)?(f)??(f) is
	a dimensionless reduced transfer function whose components ??1 and
	??1 account for a weak correlation between the interferometer?s two
	corner test masses and a slight reduction of the noise due to the
	height of the test masses above the Earth?s surface. This paper?s
	primary foci are (i) a study of how ??(f)??(f) depends on the various
	Rayleigh and Love modes that are present in the seismic spectrum,
	(ii) an attempt to estimate which modes are actually present at the
	two LIGO sites at quiet times and at noisy times, and (iii) a corresponding
	estimate of the magnitude of ??(f) at quiet and noisy times. We conclude
	that at quiet times ???0.35?0.6 at the LIGO sites, and at noisy times
	???0.15?1.4. (For comparison, Saulson?s simple model gave ?=??=1/?3=0.58.)
	By folding our resulting transfer function into the ?standard LIGO
	seismic spectrum,? which approximates W?(f) at typical times, we
	obtain the gravity-gradient noise spectra. At quiet times this noise
	is below the benchmark noise level of ?advanced LIGO interferometers?
	at all frequencies (though not by much at ?10Hz); at noisy times
	it may significantly exceed the advanced noise level near 10 Hz.
	The lower edge of our quiet-time noise constitutes a limit, beyond
	which there would be little gain from further improvements in vibration
	isolation and thermal noise, unless one can also reduce the seismic
	gravity gradient noise. Two methods of such reduction are briefly
	discussed: monitoring the Earth?s density perturbations near each
	test mass, computing the gravitational forces they produce, and correcting
	the data for those forces; and constructing narrow moats around the
	interferometers? corner and end stations to shield out the fundamental-mode
	Rayleigh waves, which we suspect dominate at quiet times.},

	It is generally admitted that it leads to an ultimate sensitivity,
	the "standard quantum limit". Using a semi-classical analysis of
	quantum noise, we show that a judicious use of squeezed states allows
	one in principle to push the sensitivity beyond this limit. This
	general method could be applied to large-scale interferometers for
	gravitational wave detection.},

  abstract={Recent gamma-ray burst observations have revealed late-time, highly energetic events that deviate from the simplest expectations of the standard fireball picture. Instead, they may indicate that the central engine is active or restarted at late times. We suggest that fragmentation and subsequent accretion during the collapse of a rapidly rotating stellar core offers a natural mechanism for this.}

	was collected at design sensitivity. Much of this run was also coincident
	with the data runs of interferometers in Europe, GEO600 and Virgo.
	The joint analysis of data from this international network of detectors
	is ongoing. No gravitational wave signals have been detected in analyses
	completed to date. Currently two of the LIGO detectors are being
	upgraded to increase their sensitivity in a program called Enhanced
	LIGO. The Enhanced LIGO detectors will start another roughly one-year
	long data run with increased sensitivity in 2009. In parallel, construction
	of Advanced LIGO, a major upgrade to LIGO, has begun. Installation
	and commissioning of Advanced LIGO hardware at the LIGO sites will
	commence at the end of the Enhanced LIGO data run in 2011. When fully
	commissioned, the Advanced LIGO detectors will be ten times as sensitive
	as the initial LIGO detectors. Advanced LIGO is expected to make

	 temperatures and due to its very high thermal conductivity, allowing
	the heat deposited in the
	
	 mirrors by high power lasers to be efficiently extracted. To accomplish
	such a scheme, both
	
	 mirror masses and suspension elements must be made of silicon, then
	bonded together forming
	
	 a quasi-monolithic stage. Elements can be assembled using hydroxide-catalysis
	silicate bonding,
	
	 as for silica monolithic joints. The effect of Si to Si bonding on
	suspension thermal conductance
	
	 has therefore to be experimentally studied. A measurement of the
	effect of silicate bonding on
	
	 thermal conductance carried out on 1 inch thick silicon bonded samples,
	from room temperature

	both in the presence and absence of coherent fields are shown, including
	a comparison with coherent locking techniques. Finally, we use NL

  abstract = {Two types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are observed: short-duration
	hard spectrum GRBs and long-duration soft spectrum GRBs. For many
	years long GRBs were the focus of intense research while the lack
	of observational data limited the study of short-hard GRBs (SHBs).
	In 2005 a breakthrough occurred following the first detections of
	SHB afterglows, longer wavelength emission that follows the burst
	of gamma-rays. Similarly to long GRBs, afterglow detections led to
	the identification of SHB host galaxies and measurement of their
	redshifts. These observations established that SHBs are cosmological
	relativistic sources that, unlike long GRBs, do not originate from
	the collapse of massive stars, and therefore constitute a distinct
	physical phenomenon. One viable model for SHB origin is the coalescence
	of compact binary systems (double neutron stars or a neutron star
	and a black hole), in which case SHBs are the electromagnetic counterparts
	of strong gravitational-wave sources. The theoretical and observational
	study of SHBs following the recent pivotal discoveries is reviewed,
	along with new theoretical results that are presented here for the
	first time.},

	wave detector currently under construction in Germany. In particular
	we describe the triple pendulum, which is a key aspect of the overall
	system, discuss the details of the mechanical design, present transfer
	functions of the isolation performance, and display examples of impulse
	responses for the local control used to damp the low frequency modes
	of the triple pendulum. This local control is achieved using co-located
	sensing and feedback at the highest mass of the triple pendulum,
	providing a significant attenuation of local control noise to the
	fused silica test mass, the lowest mass of the triple pendulum. In
	order to enhance the vertical isolation, the triple pendulum will
	incorporate two stages of cantilever springs, and fused silica fibers
	will be used in the lowest pendulum stage in order to minimize thermal
	noise from the pendulum modes. It is expected that the thermal noise
	associated with the internal modes of the fused silica test mass
	(mass ~6 kg) will set the sensitivity limit for GEO 600 from 50 to
	~200 Hz. The measured performance from individual stages of the prototype
	suspension system indicates that a seismic noise level which is a
	factor ~3 lower than this thermal noise level at 50 Hz can be achieved.

	Indications are that with sufficient resolution this scheme is capable

	event. As an example we show results from the evolution of a binary
	composed of two equal mass, nonspinning black holes, through a single
	plunge orbit, merger, and ringdown. The resultant black hole is estimated
	to be a Kerr black hole with angular momentum parameter a?0.70. At
	present, lack of resolution far from the binary prevents an accurate
	estimate of the energy emitted, though a rough calculation suggests
	on the order of 5{\%} of the initial rest mass of the system is radiated
	as gravitational waves during the final orbit and ringdown.},

	wave (GW) radiation, a sufficient stability is required for GW antennas
	to allow long-term observation. In practice, seismic excitation is
	one of the most common disturbances effecting the stable operation
	of suspended-mirror laser interferometers. A straightforward means
	to allow a more stable operation is therefore to locate the antenna,
	the ?observatory,? at a ?quiet? site. A laser interferometer gravitational
	wave antenna with a baseline length of 20 m (LISM) was developed
	at a site 1000 m underground, near Kamioka, Japan. This project was
	a unique demonstration of a prototype laser interferometer for gravitational
	wave observation located underground. The extremely stable environment
	is the prime motivation for going underground. In this paper, the
	demonstrated ultrastable operation of the interferometer and a well-maintained
	antenna sensitivity are reported.},

	the spectrum of squeezed vacuum states downwards into the acoustic

	demand to quantum optics experiments. We demonstrate a system that
	produces nonclassical continuous variable states of light that are
	squeezed at sideband frequencies below 100 kHz. A single optical
	parametric amplifier (OPA) is used in an optical noise cancellation
	scheme providing squeezed vacuum states with coherent bright phase
	modulation sidebands at higher frequencies. The system has been stably
	locked to a reference laser beam for half an hour limited by thermal
	stability of our laboratory.},

	substrate. In each case sodium silicate solution was used as the

	to be part of the high power laser design. In addition feedback control
	and passive noise filtering is used to reduce the fluctuations in
	the so-called prestabilized laser system (PSL). In this paper,we
	discuss the design of a 200 W PSL which is under development for
	the Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detector and will present the

	wave detectors will be discussed in general and the stabilization

	is realized by a stable planar, longitudinally pumped 12 W Nd:YAG

	cleaners are fed to the actuators of the non-planar ring oscillator

	the largest influence on the output power. In order to gain more
	output power, a combined Nd:YAG-Nd:YVO4 system is scaled to more
	than 22 W.},
