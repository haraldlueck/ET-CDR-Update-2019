The following description of squeezed light usage in gravitational wave detectors is an excerpt of the article \cite{SqueezingSchnabel2010}. 
At first glance, quantum physics imposes a fundamental limit on metrology---the science of measurement---and thus imposes a corresponding limit on the sensitivity of GW detectors.  A fundamental problem in optical interferometry is
the stochastic distribution of photons arriving at the photodiodes.  This statistical fluctuations obscure the tiny power variations caused by GW signals. Fortunately, quantum physics also provides a solution to this problem via the concept of quantum entanglement.

``Quantum metrology'' uses quantum entanglement to improve the measurement precision beyond the limit set by measurement counting noise. The first such proposal was made by C.M.\ Caves in 1981 when he suggested the use of squeezed states of light as an (additional) input for laser interferometric GW detectors~\cite{Caves1981}. Caves's initial proposal was motivated by the limited laser power available at the time. Indeed, squeezed states allow for improvement in the sensitivity of a quantum noise limited interferometer without increasing the circulating laser power. %\textcolor{red}{OVERLAP with Sec.\ref{subsec:qnft}}

Without squeezing, the optical path length modulation at 1284\,Hz is neither visible in the time series of the photo-electron current (c, simulation by B. Hage, AEI) nor in its noise power spectrum (d, measurement, courtesy of H. Vahlbruch, AEI \cite{VahlbruchPhD08}). In (c) as well as in (d), the signal is clearly visible when squeezing is applied (ii).}

Squeezed states \cite{Yuen1976,Walls1983,Breitenbach1997,Dodonov2002} belong to the class of so-called \textit{nonclassical} states of light.
Generally, nonclassical states are those that cannot be described by a classical (positive valued) probability distribution using the coherent states as a basis (the $P$-representation) \cite{GerryKnight}. Let us first consider the coherent states. If light in a coherent state is absorbed by a photodiode, mutually independent photon `clicks' (in terms of photo-electrons) are recorded, a process that is described by a Poissonian counting statistics. Due to quantum mechanics, every individual `click' is not predictable, but rather the result of a truly random process. If the number of photons per time interval is large ($N\!>\!\!>\!1$), its standard deviation is given by $\sqrt{N}$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzIll}\,a\,(i). This uncertainty gives rise to \textit{shot-noise}. For a \emph{squeezed} light beam, the detection of photons is not time-independent but instead contains quantum correlations.  Nevertheless, the photon statistics still cannot be predicted by some external clock. It instead shows auto-correlations that give rise to a reduced standard deviation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzIll}\,a\,(ii). The correlations might be described in the following way. Whenever the quantum statistics might drive the actual photon number above the average value $N$, a similar number of photons destructively interferes with the main body of photons providing a (partial) compensation of the fluctuation. These quantum correlations \textit{squeeze} the interferometer's shot-noise below its natural value. Another complementary way of describing the properties of squeezed states is based on the phase space quasi-probability distribution using the amplitude and phase quadratures of a light wave (the Wigner function) \cite{Walls1983,GerryKnight}.

A squeezed state that contains only quantum-correlated photons with no coherent amplitude is called a \textit{squeezed vacuum state} \cite{GerryKnight}. If such a state is overlapped with a coherent laser beam on a semi-transparent beam splitter, two beam splitter outputs are generated which are quantum correlated. As a consequence, the overall (bi-partite) quantum state cannot be written in terms of products of the two beam splitter output states. Such a quantum state is called non-separable or \textit{entangled}. This is exactly what happens if a squeezed state is injected into the signal output port of a laser interferometer for GW detection (Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzIll}\,b). The two \textit{high-power} light fields in the interferometer arms get entangled and the light's quantum fluctuations in the two arms are correlated with each other. Although the fluctuations are not predictable from the outside, they provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio in the interferometer. Recall that an interferometer measures the optical path length change in one interferometer arm with respect to the other arm. If the quantum noise in the two arms is correlated it will cancel out.
This entanglement interpretation was not discussed in the initial proposal by Caves.  Nevertheless, it shows that the application of squeezed states in interferometers is a real application of quantum metrology by its very own definition. The entanglement produced by splitting a squeezed state at a semi-transparent beam splitter was tomographically characterized and quantified in \cite{DiGuglielmo2007}. Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzIll}\,c shows a simulated signal from a photodiode, without (i) and with (ii) \textit{squeezing}. The tiny modulation in the interferometer's output light due to the (simulated) passing GW is visible only with the improved signal-to-noise ratio. Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzIll}\,d shows the analogue in frequency space, i.e.\ after a Fourier transform of the photo current was applied.

The above paragraph shows that squeezed states can be conveniently combined with the extremely
high photon numbers of coherent light to improve a laser interferometer, as proposed in \cite{Caves1981}
and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzIll}\,b. In fact, the stronger the squeezing
factor \cite{Walls1983,GerryKnight} the greater the path entanglement and the signal-to-noise
improvement. %Very strong path entanglement is present in interferometers using so-called NOON-states instead of squeezed states.  NOON states are another class of nonclassical states \cite{GerryKnight04,HBu93,WPAUGZ04,AAS10}.   Unfortunately, the strong entanglement of a NOON state is extremely fragile, in particular if $N$ is large. Very recently a NOON-state with $N=5$ photons was demonstrated \cite{AAS10}. However, gravitational wave detectors use coherent high-power laser light with $N \approx 10^{23}$ photons per second. An improvement by use of NOON states is, therefore, far out of reach.

Shortly after Caves proposed squeezed states of light for laser
interferometers in 1981, the first experimental demonstration of squeezed
light \cite{Slusher1985} and proof of principle demonstrations of
quantum metrology were achieved \cite{Xiao1987,Grangier1987}. In parallel, it was theoretically discovered that squeezed states offer even more advances in metrology than `just' reducing the quantum shot-noise.
From the early days of quantum physics, when fundamental
aspects of the measurement process were discussed, it was clear that,
in general, a measurement disturbs the system to be measured
\cite{Braginsky1999}. %Braginsky95}.
 The measurement of quantity $A$ (say
a position of a mirror) increases the uncertainty of the
non-commuting quantity $B$ (say the mirror's momentum). Both
observables are linked by a Heisenberg Uncertainty relation. For
repeated measurements of $A$, the increased uncertainty in $B$
disturbs the measurement of $A$ at later times. This is referred to
as \textit{quantum back-action noise}. Here, the back-action arises
from the fluctuating radiation pressure due to the reflected light \cite{CavesPRL451980}.
It is significant if the mirror's mass is low and a
large photon number is reflected. In the 1970s, ideas were developed
that showed how, in principle, back-action noise for continuous
measurements can be avoided. Such schemes were called
quantum-non-demolition (QND) measurements \cite{Thorne1978, BraginskyRMP1996}.
However, for laser interferometric GW detectors
using \textit{quasi-free} falling mirrors it remained unclear if QND schemes
exist. In \cite{CavesPRL451980,Caves1981} it was concluded that back-action noise
of a free mass position measurement can in principle not be avoided and, together with photon counting noise, defines a \textsl{standard
quantum limit} (SQL). In \cite{Yuen1983,Unruh1983} it was argued, however, that measurements below the
SQL of a free mass are indeed possible. The discussion
remained controversial \cite{CavesPRL1985} until Jaekel and Reynaud
\cite{Jaekel1990} were able to convincingly show that the cleverly
arranged squeezed states in a GW detector can simultaneously reduce
the shot-noise and the radiation pressure noise, by almost arbitrary
amounts (as long as most of the photons belong to the light's coherent displacement).
%\textcolor{red}{Refer to Sec.~\ref{subsec:qnft}, great overlap, arrange Secs properly... }

So far no experiment has achieved a position measurement with
sensitivity even at, let alone below, its standard quantum limit.
Eventually this will be achieved, possibly first in future
gravitational wave detectors.  Advanced detectors are in
fact designed to have a sensitivity at or just below their SQLs.
Once the SQL is reached a new level of quantum metrology is achieved, because the position-momentum
uncertainty of the mirror becomes correlated with the quadrature
uncertainty of the reflected optical field. In this way, entanglement
between the mechanical and the optical system can be observed
\cite{Vitali2007}. This is all the more remarkable from the perspective of GW detectors
since we are talking about mirrors with masses of 40 kg, planned for
the upcoming improvement to LIGO---the Advanced LIGO~\cite{aLIGO}, and even in the order of 100\,kg concerning the envisaged LF-detector of ET.
Eventually, even two such mirrors might be projected via entanglement swapping
\cite{Pirandola2006} into an entangled state~\cite{M-Ebhardt2008}.
Obviously quantum metrology opens the possibility for further
studies of the peculiarities of quantum physics at a macroscopic scale.

\paragraph{Squeezed light for Gravitational wave astronomy}\label{subsec:SQZforGWD}

Laser interferometers for GW astronomy are facing extreme sensitivity requirements that can only be achieved if all available
tools, inclusive of quantum metrology, are combined in an elaborate measurement device.  Squeezed light must be generated in a non-linear
interaction. Squeezed light was first produced in 1985 by
Slusher et al.\ using four-wave-mixing in Na atoms in an optical
cavity \cite{Slusher1985}. Shortly after, squeezed light was also
generated by four-wave-mixing in an optical fibre \cite{Shelby1986}
and by parametric down-conversion in an optical cavity containing a
second order non-linear material \cite{Wu1986}. In these early day
experiments, squeezing of a few percent to 2  to 3\,dB were routinely observed (For an
overview of earlier experiments and squeezed light generation in
the continuous-wave as well as pulsed regime please refer to Ref.~\cite{BachorRalph2004}).


\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[scale = 1]{./Sec_Optics/SqzGen.pdf}
  \vspace{-1mm}
\caption{{\textbf{Generation of squeezed light} (a) A continuous-wave laser beam at the GW detector wavelength is first spatially filtered and then up-converted to a field at half the wavelength (second harmonic generation, SHG). That beam is then mode-matched into the `squeezing resonator' in which a tiny fraction of the up-converted photons are spontaneously down-converted by optical parametric amplification (OPA) producing a squeezed vacuum state. The squeezing factor is validated by a balanced homodyne detector (BHD). SHG as well as OPA are realized by a non-linear crystal (b), here a 6\,mm long MgO:LiNbO$_3$ crystal, inside an optical resonator (c) formed by an external cavity mirror and the dielectrically coated crystal back surface. The two non-linear resonators may be constructed in an identical way and are put into temperature stabilized housings (d).}

\label{fig:SqzGen}
\end{figure}

GW detectors are operated with high-power, quasi-monochromatic
continuous-wave laser light with an almost Fourier-limited spatial
distribution of a Gaussian TEM$_{00}$ mode. For a non-classical
sensitivity improvement, squeezed light in exactly the same
spatio-temporal mode must be generated and mode-matched into the
output port of the interferometer \cite{Caves1981}, providing
interference with the high-power coherent laser beam at the
interferometer's central beam splitter. High-power lasers for GW
astronomy are based on optically pumped solid-state crystals in
resonators \cite{Frede2006}%\textcolor{red}{refer to sec 'Pre-stabilized laser'}
, suggestive of a similar configuration for
a ``squeezed light resonator''. Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzGen}\,(a) shows a
schematic setup for generation of squeezed light that is built upon one of the very first squeezing experiments \cite{Wu1986}, a setup that has been used in many experiments thereafter
\cite{Furusawa1998,Bowen2003,Schneider1998,Lam1999}. The setup uses a solid
state laser similar to those used as master lasers in high-power
systems. After spatial mode filtering, second harmonic
generation (SHG) in an optical cavity containing a second-order
non-linear crystal is applied to produce laser light at twice the
optical frequency. The second harmonic light is then mode-matched
into the squeezing resonator to pump a degenerate optical parametric amplifier.

Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzGen}\,(b-d) show photographs of the non-linear crystal, the optical arrangement and the housing of a squeezing resonator. The crystal is temperature-stabilized at its phase-matching temperature. At this temperature the first-order dielectric
polarization of the birefringent crystal material with respect to the pump is
optimally overlapped with the second-order dielectric polarization of
the resonator mode at the fundamental laser frequency. This ensures
a high energy transfer from the pump field to the fundamental
Gaussian TEM$_{00}$ resonator mode, i.e.\ efficient parametric down
conversion.

Initially, the resonator mode is not excited by photons
around the fundamental frequency, i.e.\ it is in its ground state,
characterized by vacuum fluctuations due to the zero point energy
\cite{GerryKnight}. Note that the process is typically operated
\textit{below} oscillation threshold in order to reduce phase noise coupling
from the pump \cite{Reid1989}.  This setup produces a squeezed vacuum
state \cite{GerryKnight}. The down-converted photon pairs leaving the squeezing
resonator exhibit quantum correlations which give rise to a squeezed
photon counting noise when overlapped with a bright coherent local
oscillator beam. The squeezed field is detected by interfering it
with a coherent local oscillator beam, either in a balanced homodyne
detector (BHD), see Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzGen}\,(a), or when injected into a GW
detector and detected with a local oscillator from the GW detector
along with an interferometric phase signal, see Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzIll}. The closer
the squeezing resonator is operated to its oscillation threshold,
and the lower the optical loss on down-converted photon pairs, the
greater the squeeze factor is. For instance, the observation of a
squeezing factor of 2
is only possible if the
overall optical loss is less than 50\%~\cite{BachorRalph2004}. \textbf{A
90\% nonclassical noise reduction, i.e.\ a squeezing factor of 10, or
10\,dB, already limits the allowed optical loss to less
than 10\%.}

Although squeezed light was demonstrated in the 1980s
shortly after the first applications were
proposed~\cite{Slusher1985,Shelby1986,Wu1986}, several important challenges pertaining to the application of
squeezed states to GW detectors remained unsolved until recently.

First, squeezing has always been demonstrated at megahertz
frequencies, where technical noise of the laser light sources is not present.  At these frequencies, the laser operates at or near the shot-noise limit.  In the 10\,Hz to
10\,kHz band where terrestrial GW detectors operate,
technical noise masked and overwhelmed the observation of squeezing.  For example, acoustic, laser relaxation oscillation thermal and mechanical fluctuations can be many orders of magnitude larger than shot noise.
Until recently, it was not certain that a laser field could even be squeezed and matched to the
slow oscillation period of GWs.
Second, it was previously not known whether squeezed light was fully
compatible with other extremely sophisticated technologies employed
in GW detectors, such as signal-recycling.
Third, the technology to reliably produce stable and strong
squeezing with large squeeze factors was lacking.  Long term observation of strong squeezing was a technical challenge until recently.

These challenges have all been overcome in the past decade.  All the open questions have now been satisfactorily addressed.  This development is very timely since many known advanced classical interferometric techniques have almost been exhausted.  Many remaining classical improvements are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to implement.

The horizontal sections of traces (i) correspond to shot-noise, serving as reference levels (0\,dB), respectively.  Current best performance of a squeezed light laser for GW detection shows an up to 9\,dB squeezed noise over the complete detection band of ground-based GW detectors~\cite{VahlbruchCQG2010}.}
\label{fig:SqzAudio}
\end{figure}



\textbf{Generation of squeezing in the audio-band}\; A major
breakthrough in achieving squeezing in the audio band was the
insight that the dominant noise at audio frequencies that
degrades squeezed light generation couples via the coherent laser
field that was used to control the length of the squeezed light
laser resonator, whereas noise coupling via the second harmonic
pump field is insignificant \cite{Bowen2002,Schnabel2004}. This led
to the first demonstration of audio-band squeezing at frequencies
down to 200\,Hz \cite{McKenzie2004}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzAudio}\,a. There the length of the squeezing
resonator was stabilized without a bright control beam by using the phase sensitivity of the squeezing itself---a technique known as quantum noise locking~\cite{McKenzie2005}. Subsequently a coherent beam control scheme was invented \cite{Vahlbruch2006} for simultaneous control of both the squeezing resonator length and the squeezing angle \cite{GerryKnight}. Shortly thereafter another noise source was
identified and mitigated, which allowed for squeezing of more than
6\,dB throughout the audio-band down to 1\,Hz \cite{Vahlbruch2007}. This
noise source arose due to tiny numbers of photons that were
scattered from the main laser beam and rescattered into the audio
band squeezing mode after having experienced a frequency shift due
to vibrations and thermal expansions of potential scattering
surfaces, an effect known as \textit{parasitic interferences}. Since
bright laser beams cannot be completely avoided, the recipe for the
generation of audio-band squeezing turned out to be fourfold:
avoiding scattering by using ultra-clean super-polished optics,
avoiding rescattering by carefully blocking all residual faint beams
caused by imperfect anti-reflecting surfaces, reduce the
vibrationally and thermally excited motion of all mechanical parts
that could potentially act as a re-scattering surface and avoid pointing fluctuations \cite{McKenzie2007}.

\textbf{Compatibility of squeezing with other interferometer techniques}\; Current detectors achieve their exquisite
sensitivity to GWs due to their kilometre-scale arm lengths, the
enormous light powers circulating in the enhancement resonators
(arm, power- and signal-recycling cavities),
and sophisticated pendulum suspensions that isolate the test mass
mirrors from the environment (Fig.~\ref{fig3}).
When these
techniques were developed, squeezing was not envisioned to become an
integrated part of such a system. Building on existing theoretical
work~\cite{Gea-Banacloche1987,OpticalSpringHarms2003}, a series of experimental demonstrations
of squeezed state injection into GW detectors were carried out.
These included compatibility with power recycling, with signal
recycling~\cite{McKenzie2002,Vahlbruch2005}, and with the dynamical system of
suspended, quasi-free mirrors~\cite{Goda2008,Schnabel2008}.


\textbf{Generation of strong squeezing}\; Squeezing has significant
impact in quantum metrology if large squeezing factors can be
produced. Squeezing of 3\,dB improves the signal-to-noise ratio by a
factor of $\sqrt{2}$, equivalent to doubling the power of the
coherent laser input. Squeezing of 10\,dB corresponds to a ten-fold
power increase. Remarkably, the experimentally demonstrated
squeezing factors have virtually exploded in recent years~\cite{Takeno2007,Vahlbruch2008,Polzik2008}, culminating in values
as large as 12.7\,dB~\cite{Eberle2010}.
All the squeezing factors above
10\,dB were observed with monolithic resonators and at MHz
frequencies. However, reduced optical loss in non-monolithic resonators and a careful elimination of
parasitic interferences should in principle enable such factors
also in the GW band.  A 8 to 10\,dB improvement based on strong squeezing seems
realistic for future GW detectors in their shot-noise limited band \cite{Eberle2010}.

So far, strong squeezing values have been reported for a wavelength of 1064\,nm. However, the procedure of squeezed light generation is also applicable for the wavelength of 1550\,nm that will be required for future, cryogenic GW detectors.
Recently, the generation of  squeezing at a wavelength of 1550\,nm  was reported in a first proof-of-principle experiment~\cite{Mehmet2009}.



\textbf{The first squeezed light laser for GW detection}\; Based on
the previous achievements reviewed here, very recently the first
squeezed light laser for the continuous operation in GW detectors was
designed and completed \cite{VahlbruchPhD08,VahlbruchCQG2010}. Up to
9\,dB of squeezing over the entire GW detection band have been
demonstrated (Fig.~\ref{fig:SqzAudio}b). This laser produces squeezed vacuum
states and is fully controlled via co-propagating frequency-shifted bright control
beams. This 9\,dB squeezing factor is limited by technical effects:
the squeezing resonator has to have an adjustable air gap to allow
for an easy way to apply length control. The anti-reflection coated surface
in the resonator introduces additional loss and reduces the escape
efficiency. Moreover, a Faraday isolator has to be used in the
squeezed beam path in order to eliminate parasitic interferences.
This rotator produces a single pass photon loss of about 2\%. This
squeezed light source is designated for continuous operation in the
GEO600 GW detector. A squeezed light source based on a design that should have less sensitivity to retro-scattered light \cite{McKenzie2006} is being prepared for deployment on one of the most sensitive
detectors, the 4\,km LIGO detector in Hanford, Washington.

\subsection{Filter cavities}\label{sec:filtercavities}

The necessity of filter cavities for a broadband quantum noise reduction with a squeezed state of light was described in Secs.~\ref{subsec:QNRsqz} and \ref{subsec:SQZforGWD} (see also Sec.~\ref{subsec:qnft}). In the following sections, the technical requirements for these optical filters are discussed. An important point is the required baseline length of these filter cavities in view of their optical round-trip loss (Sec.~\ref{subsec:FClength}). The tolerances of the determined design parameters will be discussed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:robustparam}.   Furthermore, in Sec.~\ref{subsec:fcscattering} the optical layout with regard to the round-trip loss that will be mainly caused by scattering by the mirror surface defects is treated. Finally, the degradation of the squeezing level due to noise couplings (e.g.\ displacement noise in the filter cavities) will be analysed in Sec.~\ref{sec:noise}, leading to further estimates for the requirements.

\subsubsection{Restrictions for the baseline length of the filter cavity}\label{subsec:FClength}

In this Section we start with a description of the influence of optical round-trip loss on the filter cavities performance in dependence of their baseline length and half-bandwidth. The required half-bandwidth $\gamma_{\rm fc}$ and detuning
$\Phi_{\rm fc}$
(note that we will define them as angular
frequencies) of the filter cavities giving the optimal frequency-dependent squeezing angle are determined by the interferometer
configuration and its induced phase-space rotation of light fields
entering the interferometers output port. The determination of these values is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:detfcparams} in detail.

Generally, any round-trip loss will degrade the squeezing level at
sideband frequencies being resonant in the filter cavity. For a
given power round-trip loss $l^2_{\rm rt,fc}$ (mainly caused by
scattering)  the resulting loss in reflection of the filter cavity
increases with a decreasing baseline length $L_{\rm fc}$ of the
filter. As well, for a certain length  $L_{\rm fc}$ and a certain
round-trip loss $l^2_{\rm rt,fc}$ the loss imposed on the squeezed
field increases with a decreasing half-bandwidth $\gamma_{\rm fc}$
that needs to be realized. Starting from the expression for the
half-bandwidth of a lossy cavity
\begin{equation} \gamma_{\rm fc} = \frac{c}{2 L_{fc}}
\arccos\left(1-\frac{(1-\rho_{\rm c}\sqrt{1- l^2_{\rm
rt,fc}})^2}{2\rho_{\rm c}\sqrt{1- l^2_{\rm
rt,fc}}}\right)\,\label{eq:gamma}
\end{equation}
one can derive the filter cavity's coupling mirror power reflectance
$R_{\rm c}=\rho_{\rm c}^2$ that is required to achieve the
targeted half-bandwidth. One obtains
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm c} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- l^2_{\rm
rt,fc}}}\left[2-\cos(\mathcal{F}^\prime) -
\sqrt{\cos^2(\mathcal{F}^\prime)-4 \cos(\mathcal{F}^\prime)+3}
\right]\label{eq:rc}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}^\prime =  \frac{2 \gamma_{\rm fc} L_{\rm fc}}{c} =
\frac{\gamma_{\rm fc}}{{\rm FSR_{fc}}}
=\frac{\pi}{\mathcal{F}_{\rm fc}}\,.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 1.2]{./Sec_Optics/FCsgammaAI75ppm.pdf}
\caption{Filter cavity properties in dependence of its half-bandwidth $\gamma_{\rm fc}$.  a) the remaining detectable squeezing level in reflection of the filter cavity and b) its reflectance at the frequency $\Omega =  \Phi_{\rm fc}L_{\rm fc}/c$. In c) the value for $L_{\rm cc}$ is shown according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:lcc}).  Curve d) shows the finesse and e) the coupling mirror reflectance $R_{\rm c}$ given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:rc}). For all traces a filter cavity length $L_{\rm fc}=10\,{\rm km}$ and a round-trip loss $l_{\rm rt,fc}^2=75\,{\rm ppm}$ was assumed. An initial pure 10\,dB squeezed state was considered. It can be seen that the impact of the round-trip loss becomes significant for $\gamma_{\rm fc}<2\pi\cdot10\,{\rm Hz}$.} \label{fig:gamma}
\end{figure}

Graph e) in Fig.~\ref{fig:gamma} shows the value for $R_{\rm
c}=\rho_{\rm c}^2$ according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:rc}). In the
underlying calculations the baseline length $L_{\rm fc}$ and the
round-trip loss $l_{\rm rt,fc}^2$ were considered with 10\,km and
75\,ppm, respectively.  The tuning of the filter cavity was
exemplary set to $\Phi_{\rm fc}=\gamma_{\rm fc}L_{\rm fc}/c$. It
can be seen, that for small half-bandwidths $\gamma_{\rm fc}$ the
reflectance  $R_{\rm c}$ comes close to unity.  Correspondingly,
the resulting finesse rises as shown in Graph d). It can be seen
from Eq.~(\ref{eq:rc}) that there are two fundamental restrictions
for the choice of the filter cavity length. First, for great
values of the finesse (i.e.\ for small half-bandwidths) we obtain
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\gamma_{\rm fc} \to 0} \rho_{\rm c} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-l_{\rm rt,fc}^2}}> 1
\end{equation}
which does not represent a physical solution. Thus, there must
exist a value $L_{\rm min}$ such that for $L_{\rm min} < L_{\rm
fc}$ we always have $\rho_{\rm c}<1$. The expression for $L_{\rm
min}$ can be derived to
\begin{equation}
L_{\rm{min}} =
\frac{c}{2\gamma_{\rm{fc}}}\arccos\left[2-\frac{2-l_{\rm{rt,fc}}^2}{2\sqrt{1-l_{\rm{rt,fc}}^2}}\right]\,.
\end{equation}

Second, for $L_{\rm fc} < L_{\rm cc}$ we obtain $\rho_{\rm
c}>\sqrt{1-l_{\rm rt,fc}^2}$ and the filter cavity becomes
under-coupled. But even in the most general case, the
interferometer represents an over-coupled cavity. Hence, an
under-coupled filter cavity with $L_{\rm fc} < L_{\rm cc}$ can not
provide the phase-space rotation required for the generation of
the optimal squeezing angle.

To keep  $\rho_{\rm c}<\sqrt{1-l_{\rm rt,fc}^2}$ the filter cavity length needs to be
\begin{equation}
L_{\rm fc} > L_{\rm cc} =
\frac{c}{2\gamma_{\rm{fc}}}\arccos\left[2-\frac{1+(1-l_{\rm
rt,fc}^2)^2}{2(1-l_{\rm rt,fc}^2)}\right]\label{eq:lcc}
\end{equation}
Note that for $L_{\rm fc}=L_{\rm cc}$ the filter cavity is
critically coupled (impedance matched) and the loss in its
reflection is maximum. Therefore, to preserve the squeezing in
reflection of the filter cavities its length should be chosen with
$L_{\rm fc} \gg L_{\rm cc}$. This fact becomes obvious when
looking at graph a) and b) of Fig.~\ref{fig:gamma}. They show the
squeezing level in reflection of the filter cavity and the according reflectance of the filter cavity at its resonance frequency, respectively. At small half-bandwidths the
value for $L_{\rm cc}$ (graph c)) is of the order of the filter
cavity's baseline length $L_{\rm fc}=10\,{\rm km}$ and hence the reflectance
and accordingly the remaining squeezing level are considerably
reduced.

The top grey shaded area in graph a) highlights the anti-squeezed region. Due to the unbalanced loss for upper and lower squeezing sidebands in the detuned filter cavity, for high resulting loss (i.e.\ for a cavity reflectance much smaller than one) the detected noise can be even enhanced when compared to the vacuum noise (refer to Fig.~\ref{fig:sqzphspic}). In the considered example the detected noise is already enhanced (anti-squuezed) for filter cavity baseline lengths smaller than approximately 2.5\,km.}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:length}  the filter cavity performance is shown
depending on its baseline length $L_{\rm fc}$. In the
corresponding calculations we assumed the target half-bandwidth
with ${\gamma_{\rm fc} = 2\pi\cdot1.4\,{\rm Hz}}$ and the target detuning with
${\Phi_{\rm fc_1}= 2\pi\cdot 6.6\,{\rm Hz}\cdot L_{\rm fc_1}/c}$.
Note, that these values are approximately the requirements for one of the filter
cavities that needs to be realised in the ET-LF
detector~\cite{Hild2010a}. Again, the round-trip loss was
considered of 75\,ppm and the initial squeezing level of 10\,dB.  Graph a)
demonstrates, that even with a filter cavity length of 10\,km the
amount of squeezing  is already reduced by a factor of about
4\,dB. For lengths smaller than about 2.5\,km the unbalanced loss for upper and lower squeezing sidebands results in a noise enhancement (anti-squeezing) when compared to vacuum noise in reflection of the filter cavity.  At the crtical length $L_{\rm fc} = L_{\rm
cc}\approx1239\,\rm m$ this enhancement becomes maximum and corresponds to about 5\,dB anti-squeezing. For lengths smaller than $L_{\rm cc}$  the noise level drops and squeezing can be achieved again (grey shaded area~II) until it reaches at $L_{\rm fc} =
L_{\min}$ the initial level of 10\,dB. However, in this region the
filter is under-coupled and does not yield the required
phase-space rotation of the squeezed field. This can be understood
when considering the extreme case for $L_{\rm fc} = L_{\min}$.
Here, $R_{\rm c}$ is equal to one and  the filter cavity can be
replaced by  an ordinary mirror that has no frequency dependence.
Again, it can be deduced that a filter cavity length  $L_{\rm fc}
\gg L_{\rm cc}$ needs to be realised in order to preserve the
squeezing. In addition, the high finesse of a short cavity might
pose a problem for the lock acquisition in the environment of a gravitational-wave detector where the optics
needs to be suspended.

So far in Figs.~\ref{fig:gamma} and~\ref{fig:length} the squeezing level was shown in reflection of the considered filter cavities at its resonance frequency. Here the  (frequency-dependent) imposed loss is maximum. Now, for  exemplification
Fig.~\ref{fig:sqz} shows squeezing spectra obtained after the
reflection at two subsequent filter cavities FC$_1$ and FC$_2$.
The considered  half-bandwidths and tunings of these filters are
those needed for the ET-LF detector. The length of the cavities
were considered with  $L_{\rm fc_1}=L_{\rm fc_2}=2\,{\rm km}$ (red
curve), $L_{\rm fc_1}=L_{\rm fc_2}=5\,{\rm km}$ (blue curve) and
$L_{\rm fc_1}=L_{\rm fc_2}=10\,{\rm km}$ (green curve),
respectively.


The calculations and exemplary filter properties considered within
this Section imply that in 3rd generation GWADS
detectors such as the Einstein Telescope, where filter cavities with half-bandwidths
in the range of ${\gamma_\text{fc}\approx 2\pi\cdot1- 2\pi\cdot5\,\mathrm{Hz}}$ will be
required, the baseline length of these filters needs to be in the
order of a few kilometers. This contrasts to the results presented
in~\cite{Khalili2009} for the Advanced LIGO
detector. As for the Advanced LIGO configuration filter cavities with
half-bandwidths in the order of ${2\pi\cdot50- 2\pi\cdot200\,{\rm Hz}}$ will be required, a
considerable sensitivity increase by the injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light can already be achieved if filter
cavities with lengths in the order of 100\,m are utilised. Certainly,
our exemplary calculations are based on a conservative assumption
of 75\,ppm for the round-trip loss of the filter cavities, but
even if optimistic values of $l_{\rm rt,fc}^2=20\,\mathrm{ppm}$ are
considered, the corresponding values for the critical lengths will
be $L_{\rm cc, fc_1} = 330\,{\rm m}$ and  $L_{\rm cc, fc_2} =
84\,{\rm m}$, respectively. As shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:gamma}
and \ref{fig:length} the respective length $L_{\rm fc}$ should be
at least 10 times greater than $L_{\rm cc}$.   I.e.\ for the ET-LF detector the  length of the two required filter cavities should be 10\,km. In contrast, it can be shown that for the ET-HF detector a filter with a length of about 300\,m is sufficient. This filter will be required for an optimisation of the squeezed quadrature in the radiation pressure noise dominated frequency band. However, in this frequency band other noise sources dominates the quantum noise. For that it is satisfactory to adapt the squeezing level to the level of these noise sources which will be possible with a comparatively short filter cavity.



The former investigation demonstrated that  the round-trip loss ultimately restricts the minimal allowed baseline length and consistently the performance of the filter cavities. As it is expected that the round-trip loss of the filters will be dominated by scattering at imperfect mirror surfaces, the optical layout needs to be designed such that the amount of scattering is as much as possible reduced. The scattering in different optical layouts is treated in Sec.~\ref{subsec:fcscattering}.

Please note, that from this comparison it can be deduced, that the tolerable loss in the filters needs to be determined also in view of the injected anti-squeezing.}

\subsubsection{Determination of the required filter parameters}\label{sec:detfcparams}

In publications by Purdue and Chen~\cite{PurduePRD66} and Harms \cite{HarmsPRD68} treating the frequency dependent squeezed light injection, some analytical expressions were derived showing first the need for filter cavities and second allow for a calculation of the required number,  bandwidth and tuning of filter cavities.
In these works the interferometer quantum noise transfer function was derived using the Caves-Schumacher two-photon formalism~\cite{Caves}. The interferometer quantum noise transfer function is then described by a $2\times 2$-matrix $\mathbf{T}$ (refer to Eq.~(3) in \cite{HarmsPRD68}).  From this matrix the required frequency-dependent squeezing angle $\lambda(\Omega)$ can be derived according to Eq.~(16) in \cite{HarmsPRD68}


\begin{equation}
\lambda(\Omega) = \arctan\left(-\frac{T_{11}\cos\zeta + T_{21}\sin\zeta}{T_{12}\cos\zeta + T_{22}\sin\zeta}\right)\,.\label{eq:lopt}
\end{equation}
Here, $\Omega$ is the angular sideband frequency and $\zeta$ the read-out angle. It was shown in \cite{PurduePRD66}, that with a combination of Fabry-Perot cavities the required frequency dependent angle $\lambda(\Omega)$ can be realized. It  has the form \cite{PurduePRD66}
\begin{equation}
\tan\lambda(\Omega) = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n} B_k\Omega^{2k}}{ \sum_{k=0}^{n} A_k\Omega^{2k}}\,, \text{with}\, \left|A_n+\mathrm{i}B_n\right|>0
\end{equation}
From the corresponding characteristic equation
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \left(A_k+\mathrm{i}B_k\right)\Omega^{2k}=0\label{eq:chareq}
\end{equation}
the required bandwidth and tuning of the filter cavities can be obtained. They are given by the $2n$ roots (in $n$ pairs with a positive imaginary part) of Eq.~(\ref{eq:chareq}).
However, these calculations are based on the assumption of a lossless main interferometer, an infinite small signal-recycling cavity length,  an expansion in powers of the light's angular frequency and the approximated expression for a cavity's half-bandwidth $\gamma=c\tau/(4L)$. Thus, in general they allow just for a precise estimation for the required parameters.
Furthermore it is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:phs-vs-loss}, that it is not sufficient to realize filter cavities having the bandwidth and tuning determined by Eq.~(\ref{eq:chareq}).   First, the impact of optical loss was considered. Therefore, the phase-space rotation in reflection of a cavity with a half-bandwidth $\gamma=2\pi\cdot1.44448\,\rm Hz$ and a tuning according  to $f_{\rm res} = 6.628\,\rm Hz$ is calculated for different values of the round-trip loss. The lenght was set to 10\,km. The results are shown in the left graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:phs-vs-loss}. It can be seen that the deviation of the phase-space rotation related to the lossless case increases with increasing optical loss. Similarly, the rotation in reflection depends on the baseline length of the cavity. This fact is shown in the right graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:phs-vs-loss}. Here, the round-trip loss was set to 75\,ppm for all cases.


 \begin{figure}
 \centering
   \includegraphics{./Sec_Optics/PhsRot-residualsAI.pdf}
   \caption{The figure demonstrates, that the phase-space rotation of a Fabry-Perot cavity is not only determined by its resonance frequency and bandwidth (here exemplary set to 6.628\,Hz and 1.44448\,Hz, respectively, for all cases), but also by its round-trip loss (left) and its baseline length (right).}
   \label{fig:phs-vs-loss}
   \end{figure}


Especially under consideration of optical intra-cavity round-trip loss and a finite baseline length of the filter cavities as well as the signal-recycling cavity,
there is no possibility to determine the optimal filter cavities parameters analytically. Thus, the parameters for the filter cavities were fitted with respect to the residual phase-space rotation of injected squeezed field. Fig.~\ref{fig:phs-fit-75ppm} compares the results for the parameters determined in accordance to Eq.~\ref{eq:chareq} (red curve) and those determined by the fit (black curve) for the ET-D LF detector. The corresponding filter cavity parameters are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:fitanaparamsloss}

%\item{Statement, that with a 3MC the required $\gamma$ can be adapted by a properly chosen detuning.}
%\end{itemize}


In this section we illustrate the effect of a deviation from the determined design parameters. We will concentrate on the most obvious quantities, that will potentially  change the properties of the filter, i.e.\

\begin{enumerate}
\item{the reflectance factors of the used mirrors, }
\item{the round-trip loss,}
\item{the macroscopic length, and}
\item{the resonance frequency.}
\end{enumerate}
The first three quantities affect the bandwidth of the filter cavity and thus the required phase-space rotation around the targeted resonance frequency. A deviation from the design values of these quantities could not be compensated if the filter cavity is realised as  single resonator. An adaption of the filters bandwidth would be possible if coupled resonators---e.g.\ a linearly coupled three-mirror cavity---are utilised.  Although it should be always possible to tune the filter cavity to the required resonance frequency, for the sake of completeness we treat a potential  mismatch within this section. From the results the requirements for the length stabilisation with regard to displacement noise could be determined. This will be described in Sec.~\ref{sec:noise} in detail.

We start from the set of design parameters for the length, the detuning and the mirror reflectance factors yielding the bandwidth and phase-space rotation of the two filter cavities that are required for ET-C LF. These parameters are listed  in Table~\ref{tab:designparams}. The analysis of the impact on the achievable squeezing levels for a certain mismatch of the bandwidths will give the allowable tolerances of theses parameters.

\end{table}


To demonstrate the effect of a mismatched bandwidth we calculate the squeezing spectra after reflection at two subsequent resonators-- the required filter cavity and an auxiliary cavity which models the interferometer. For the filter cavity the design parameters (and a certain deviation of them) as listed in Table~\ref{tab:designparams} are assumed. The auxiliary one has a bandwidth and detuning  that models the transfer function and thus the phase-space rotation of the interferometer.  Consistently,  no phase-space rotation occur after subsequent reflection at these resonators if their bandwidths are matched.   Note, that  the auxiliary resonator is assumed to be loss-free so that the imperfections in the squeezing spectra can be clearly traced back to the respective deviation of the filter cavities design parameters. For a first illustration of the effect of a mismatched filter cavity bandwidth, Fig.~\ref{fig:devBWll} shows the squeezing level (top) and the residual phase-space rotation (bottom) after subsequent  reflection at both cavities. Note that here  \emph{both} cavities  were assumed to be loss-free.

\label{fig:devBWll}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:devBW} shows the performance of the filter cavities (FC$_1$ and FC$_2$)  required for the ET- LF detector. Their bandwidth was varied according to a deviation of 1\,\% to 5\,\% from the designed value. In these plots, the round-trip loss of the filter cavities was considered to be 75\,ppm.

\label{fig:devBW}
\end{figure}

If a tolerable  degradation  of the squeezing  by less than 2\,dB (related to the squeezing levels  achievable with  the  design parameters) is targeted, a deviation of the bandwidth less than 5\,\% is acceptable. From this value, the tolerances for the design parameters can be deduced. %They are listed in Tab. (XXX)

In this section several noise mechanisms that potentially limit the detected squeezing levels are discussed. First, we discuss the effect of phase noise in the squeezing path. Assuming a self-homodyning
readout (DC readout) of the interferometers  signal field, the DC part of the interferometer output field serves as local oscillator. The quadrature of the signal field that is read out is determined by its relative phase with regard to this local oscillator. In order to reduce the quantum noise of this measurement, the relative phase of the injected squeezed field needs to be chosen such that the squeezed quadrature coincides with the readout quadrature. This required phase relation gets disturbed due to e.g.\ vibrating optical components in the squeezing path (displacement noise) or residual high frequency phase modulations that probably will be required for control purposes.  If the measurement time is greater than the period of the phase jitter period, the homodyne read out is not a pure measurement of a certain quadrature   $\Phi$ (e.g.\ the squeezed quadrature) but the integral over some span of $\Phi+\delta \Phi$. In this case, a certain fraction of the noise in the anti-squeezed quadrature is mixed into the measurement that was intended to be a measurement of the squeezed quadrature. It is obvious, that such a \textit{phase diffused squeezed state}  results in a degraded squeezing level.  Accordingly, an upper limit for the overall tolerable phase noise in the squeezing path needs to be deduced with regard to the targeted quantum noise reduction of 10\,dB.

The influence of phase noise on the squeezed field can be nicely illustrated by the accordant Wigner functions. We start from the Wigner function of a squeezed state that has a certain orientation (determined by the quadrature angle  $\varphi$) in phase-space. It is  given by
\begin{equation}
W(X_{1,\varphi},X_{2,\varphi}, \varphi) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{V_sV_a}}\exp\left[-\frac{X_{1,\varphi}^2}{2V_s}-\frac{X_{2,\varphi}^2}{2V_a}\right]\,.
\end{equation}
Here $V_s$ and $V_a$ denotes the variances in the squeezed and anti-squeezed quadrature, respectively (e.g.\ for a pure 10\,dB squeezed state  $V_s=0.1$ and $V_a=10$ if normalised to the variance of the vacuum state $V_{\rm{vac}}=1$).  The orientation in phase-space is accounted for by setting
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{1,\varphi} &=& X_1\cos(\varphi) - X_2\sin(\varphi)\\
X_{2,\varphi}  &= &X_1\sin(\varphi) + X_2\cos(\varphi)\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here, the local oscillator serves as reference for the phase-space with its amplitude ($X_1$) and phase quadrature ($X_2$). The corresponding probability distribution in the amplitude quadrature ($X_1$) can be obtained from the Wigner function by integrating over $X_2$. One obtains
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{X_1} &=& \int\limits_ {-\infty}^{\infty}W_d(X_1,X_2)dX_2\\
&=&\frac{1}{{\sqrt{2\pi V_{X_1}(\varphi)}}}\exp\left[-\frac{X_1^2}{2V_{X_1}(\varphi)} \right]\,.
\end{eqnarray}
with the variance of the amplitude quadrature
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{X_1}(\varphi) &=& V_s\cos^2(\varphi) + V_a\sin^2(\varphi)\\
&=&\frac{1}{2}\left[V_s+V_a+(V_s-V_a)\cos(2\varphi)\right]\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Now, to describe a phase-diffused squeezed state, the quadrature angle $\varphi$ needs to be replaced by a probability density for the phase denoted as $\Phi(\varphi)$. Then, the Wigner function is given by
\begin{equation}
W_d(X_1,X_2) =\int \Phi(\varphi) W_d(X_1,X_2, \varphi)d\varphi\,.
\end{equation}
Again, the corresponding probability distribution in the amplitude quadrature ($X_1$) can be obtained from the Wigner function by integrating over $X_2$
\begin{equation}
P_{X_1,d} = \int\limits_ {-\infty}^{\infty}W_d(X_1,X_2)dX_2 \,.
\end{equation}
Accordingly, the variance of a phase-diffused squeezed state is given by
\begin{equation}
V_{X_1,d} = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Phi(\varphi)V_{X_1}d\varphi\,\Leftrightarrow  \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}P_{X_1,d}X_1^2dX_1\,.\label{eq:varsqzphsdiff}
\end{equation}

\label{fig:phasediffusedSQZ}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:phasediffusedSQZ} four Wigner functions  (top) and the corresponding probability distribution in the $X_1$-quadrature (bottom) are shown. We assumed a Gaussian-distributed phase noise, i.e,
\begin{equation}
\Phi(\varphi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{\phi^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
We have considered phase noise with  a standard deviation $\sigma$ of 0 (no phase noise), 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 (from left to right in Fig.~\ref{fig:phasediffusedSQZ}). The initial squeezed state (left figures) was assumed with $V_s=0.1$ and $V_a=10$, i.e.\ as a pure 10\,dB squeezed state. The degradation of the squeezing level due to phase noise becomes obvious from the comparison with the probability distribution of a vacuum state (grey traces in the bottom graphs). The probability distributions are labelled with the corresponding squeezing level. For strong phase noise  the initial squeezing is destroyed and the noise in the amplitude quadrature is even enhanced when compared to the vacuum noise (shot noise).

\caption{The degradation of the squeezing and anti-squeezing levels due to optical loss for an initially pure (no loss) 20\,dB squeezed state.}
\label{fig:20dBlosschart}
\end{figure}

The illustration in Fig.~\ref{fig:phasediffusedSQZ} implies that the larger the anti-squeezing level, the larger the effect of phase noise. In fact, in order to achieve the targeted quantum noise reduction of 10\,dB, a squeezed light source needs to be utilised that generates considerably more than 10\,dB (anti-)squeezing to compensate for possible loss. If an overall optical loss of up to 10\,\% in the squeezing path (including 1\,\% loss in the squeezed light source itself) is assumed, an initially pure 20\,dB squeezed state needs to be generated. The degradation of the squeezing (and anti-squeezing) level with optical loss is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:20dBlosschart}. Whereas the squeezing level is strongly affected by optical loss, the anti-squeezing level is not considerably reduced. Considering an overall optical loss of 10\,\% the squeezing level is reduced from 20\,dB to about 9.6\,dB, but the anti-squeezing level is still about 19.5\,dB. In Fig.~\ref{fig:phasediffusedSQZ20dB} the effect of phase noise on an initial 20\,dB squeezed state is illustrated, for which optical loss of 1\,\%, 3\,\%, 5\,\% and 10\,\% was considered. Here the phase noise was assumed with a standard deviation of $\sigma=0.3$. Again,  the top graphs show the Wigner functions and the bottom graphs the probability distribution in the amplitude quadrature. Here, in each case three traces are plotted. The red trace is the distribution of the phase diffused squeezed state and the black one that of a vacuum state. The grey curves correspond to the distribution without phase noise, i.e.\ the degradation of the squeezing level only due to the considered optical loss can be deduced. Again, it can be seen that the high phase noise destroys the squeezing. In each case, the resulting noise level is considerably enhanced when compared to the shot noise level. Please note that although the squeezing levels in the undisturbed case are $\geq$10\,dB, the high anti-squeezing level of almost 20\,dB leeds to higher noise levels when compared to the pure 10\,dB squeezed state (refer to Fig.~\ref{fig:phasediffusedSQZ}). I.e.\ in presence of phase noise the achievable squeezing level can be  optimized by reducing the anti-squeezing (and thus the squeezing) generated by the squeezed light source. On the other hand, that means that in presence of considerable phase noise a compensation of optical loss in the  squeezing path is not possible by enhancing the  squeezing (and thus the anti-squeezing) generated in the squeezed light source.

\end{figure}


In the previous investigation comparatively high values for the phase noise was considered for illustration purpuses. Such high values are not expected to be present in a realistic experimental environment. However, the upper limit for the overall phase noise in the squeezing path depends on the squeezed state, that is generated by the squeezed light source. Table~\ref{tab:phsnoiselimit} lists the allowed phase noise (i.e.\ its standard deviation) for several conditioned squeezed states. The states were constituted for several values of the optical power  loss $l^2$ such that the  squeezing level without phase noise is 10\,dB. The required squeezing  that needs to be generated inside the squeezed light source can be calculated according to
\begin{equation}
V_s = 0.1 -l^2\hspace{11pt}\text{and}\hspace{11pt}V_a = \frac{1}{V_s}.
\end{equation}
We relates the upper limit $\sigma_{\rm max}$ for the phase noise to a squeezing level that is reduced to 9\,dB due to the phase noise. As the phase noise is assumed to be Gaussian-distributed with zero mean, Eq.~(\ref{eq:varsqzphsdiff}) can be solved giving
\begin{equation}
V_{X_1,d} = \frac{1}{2}\left[V_s+V_a+(V_s-V_a)\exp\left(-2\sigma^2\right)\right]\,.\label{eq:varianzsqzpn}
\end{equation}
Soving Eq.~(\ref{eq:varianzsqzpn}) for $\sigma$ yields
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sqrt{-\frac{1}{2}\log\left[\frac{2V_{X_1,d}-V_s-V_a}{V_s-V_a}\right]}\,.
\end{equation}
From this equation the tolerable phase noise characterised  by $\sigma_{max}$ can be calculated for the targeted variance  $V_{X_1,d}=0.1$ and squeezing level of 10\,dB, respectively.

\end{table}

From the tolerable $\sigma_{\rm max}$ we will deduce in following investigations
\begin{itemize}
\item{the allowed displacement noise in the  filter cavities}
\item{the requirements for the filter cavity length stabilization}
\item{the requirements on frequency noise of the squeezed light source related to main interferometer beam}
%\item{Alignment noise/pointing?}
%\item{Scattering}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Length control of the filter cavities}
We will analyse
\begin{itemize}
\item{the realisation of a locking scheme without introducing too much optical loss (due to pick-off mirrors needed for detection ports). }
\item{the potential of using the orthogonal polarisation for error signal generation.}
\item{the restrictions to RF sidebands. They need to be in the same mode as the squeezing, therefore generated in the squeezer by means of the coherent control beam.}
%\item{RF Frequencies. Needs to be reflected at least at the OMC in order not to spoil the IFO.}
\item{A ring -vs- a linear filter cavity design. If linear filter cavities are used additional Faraday rotators are required.}
%\item{Put the above just as note at a certain point, e.g. within the noise section}
\end{itemize}
