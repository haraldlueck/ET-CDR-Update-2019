\subsection{Standard Optical Technologies}

This section describes several optical technologies, such as for instance laser and signal
detection systems, required for the realisation
of any interferometric gravitational wave detector.  In the following we refer to
these techniques as 'standard optical technologies' because when building ET
we will be able to rely on ample experience in these technologies collected 
from commissioning and operating the first and second generation of gravitational wave
detectors. 

In section~\ref{sec:injection} we describe the ET injection system consisting 
of the pre-stabilised lasers and the input mode cleaners. The readout of the 
gravitational wave signal and the design options for output mode cleaners are 
discussed in section~\ref{sec:detection}. Section~\ref{sec:control} gives an 
general overview on how to control the main optical components of ET for 
their longitudinal and angular degrees of freedom. Finally section~\ref{sec:tcs}
describes strategies to mitigate the effects of thermal lensing by means of 
thermal compensation.
